This folder is for a test block that is not definded by the RFDATS spreadsheet, but maybe a completely new project spreadsheet. 
Might involve taking params and sorting them from mission planner for eg. Nothing to do with the modem tests in the beginning. 
For new projects outside of the modem, a folder should be created and then the customised test blocks for that project can be stored in there. 
For a test stream, you can look at the custom test streams folder.
